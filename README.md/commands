🌌 Orbit AI Essay Editor  
👨‍💻 Created by HARSHAD NABISAB MULLA  
Orbit AI Essay Editor Project  
This project is a web-based essay editor enhanced with AI features. It allows users to write essays, analyze clarity, readability, and tone, rephrase text, fix grammar, summarize content, and apply tone transformations using AI. The backend is built with Node.js, and the frontend uses React with React Quill and Vite.

## Setup Instructions

### 1️⃣ Backend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to backend folder
cd backend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create a .env file with content:
# PORT=5000
# API_KEY=your_api_key_here  (if applicable)

# Start backend server
npm start
Backend runs at: http://localhost:5000
Test API endpoint: http://localhost:5000/api/analyze (POST JSON)

2️⃣ Frontend Setup
bash
Copy code
# Navigate to frontend folder
cd ../frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create .env.local file with content:
# VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000

# Run frontend in development mode
npm run dev
Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser.
Hot-reloading works for development.

bash
Copy code
# Build frontend for production
npm run build

# Install serve globally (if not installed)
npm install -g serve

# Serve the production build
serve -s dist
Access production version at http://localhost:3000.

3️⃣ Restart Commands
bash
Copy code
# Backend
cd backend
npm start

# Frontend (dev mode)
cd ../frontend
npm run dev

# Frontend (production serve)
cd frontend
serve -s dist


4️⃣ Common Issues & Fixes
Blank page or runtime errors:

Check browser console for errors.

Ensure .env.local contains correct VITE_API_URL.

Ensure all CSS braces are closed (PostCSS errors can break the page).

Port conflicts:

Backend default: 5000

Frontend dev default: 5173

Use PORT environment variable to change ports.

This is **formatted exactly like your Iris example**, with emojis, headers, commands, and notes all in one place—ready to paste in your repo.  

If you want, I can **also add screenshots placeholders** for frontend and backend so it looks even more professional on GitHub.  

Do you want me to do that?
